# sewercat
"Sewercat" is a project that is worked on in a new unity 6 project from scratch nowadays. This repository is not being worked on at the moment, though it is a project I will do something with sooner or later.

## Systems implemented in this prototype:
+ enemy AI including group tactics/fsm/behaviour trees
+ Save/Load
+ Inventory
+ modular player controller working with a finite state machine
+ Dialogue System
  
## Personal Notes
This project includes my tests with different systems for a game idea I had about playing as a humanoid rat in the sewers in an action/adventure 3d game. many ideas I have for the game are not in this project.
This has been a project I spent many months on, redoing systems as I got better at it and the project that made me love working on games and C# and I wanted to keep it as a part of my github repository as I keep working on new iterations of the systems I started to learn here.

although the systems here are a bit rough around the edges and the code isn't as clean as I'd like, It has been a major learning step in my gamedev journey although it is not a finished prototype. Will be rewritten and worked on in the future with the things I learned with this project.
