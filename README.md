# sewercat
"Sewercat" is a project that is now worked on in a new unity 6 project from scratch nowadays. This repository is not being worked on at the moment, though it is a project I will do something with sooner or later.

This project includes my tests with different systems for a game idea I had about playing as a humanoid rat in the sewers in an action/adventure 3d game. many ideas I have for the game sadly are not in it as of now.
