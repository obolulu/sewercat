# sewercat
"Sewercat" is a project that is now worked on in a new unity 6 project from scratch nowadays. This repository is not being worked on at the moment, though it is a project I will do something with sooner or later.

This project includes my tests with different systems for a game idea I had about playing as a humanoid rat in the sewers in an action/adventure 3d game. many ideas I have for the game sadly are not in it as of now.

the project includes first versions of systems I dabbled in, Including save/load for the entire world state, inventory, enemy AI including group tactics/fsm/behaviour trees, a modular player controller with a finite state machine and many more.

This has been a project I spent many months on, redoing systems as I got better at it and the project that made me love working on games and C# and I wanted to keep it as a part of my github repository as I keep working on new iterations of the systems I started to learn here.
